# Svelte

This application takes a currency amount in dollars and cents and then converts them to an amount only containing cents. After this conversion, it then takes the coins and breaks them down into the smallest amount of coins possible to represent that currency amount using the following coins:

1. Quarters
2. Dimes
3. Nickels
4. Pennies

It will return a string value that has the amount of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies in an interpolated string representing the smallest amount of possible coins for that dollar amount.
